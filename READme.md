# Combined Cycle Power Plant Energy Output Prediction

In this project, we developed a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict the net hourly energy output of a combined cycle power plant. The dataset used for this project was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (AT), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE)  of the plant.
A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance.

The dataset contains the following features:

- Ambient Temperature (AT): The ambient temperature in Celsius.
- Exhaust Vacuum (V): The exhaust vacuum value.
- Ambient Pressure (AP): The ambient pressure in millibars.
- Relative Humidity (RH): The relative humidity percentage.

The target variable is:

- Net Hourly Energy Output (PE): The net hourly energy output of the combined cycle power plant.

## Model and Evaluation

We employed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for this regression task. The ANN architecture consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The number of neurons in the input layer corresponds to the number of features in the dataset, while the output layer has a single neuron for predicting the net hourly energy output. The activation functions used for the hidden layers were Rectified Linear Units (ReLU).

The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing. The model was trained using the training data and its performance was evaluated on the testing data. The evaluation metric used for this project was the R-squared (R2) score, which measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the input features.

## Results

After training the ANN model on the dataset, we achieved an R2 score of 0.92 on the testing data. This indicates that the model explains approximately 92% of the variance in the net hourly energy output using the given input features. The high R2 score suggests that the model is a good fit for the data and has strong predictive capabilities.

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully built a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict the net hourly energy output of a combined cycle power plant based on ambient temperature, exhaust vacuum, ambient pressure, and relative humidity. The model demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving an R2 score of 0.92 on the testing data. This project showcases the effectiveness of using ANN models for regression tasks in the domain of energy output prediction.
